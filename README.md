## Additional Documentation

### For Web Projects with Backend:

#### API Documentation

**Base URL:** `https://api.yourproject.com`

##### Endpoints

**GET /api/endpoint**
- **Description:** [Our project is an AI-powered online comment analysis and moderation system designed to create safer and more positive digital spaces.
The system automatically analyzes user comments in real time using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It detects sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), identifies toxic or abusive language, and filters spam content without human intervention.
The platform provides an intelligent dashboard for administrators to monitor flagged comments and track engagement patterns. By reducing manual moderation effort, the system helps social media platforms, e-commerce websites, educational portals, and online communities maintain healthy discussions.
Our solution is scalable, API-based, and can be integrated into any web application that supports user-generated content.]
- **Parameters:**
  - `param1` (string): [Description]
  - `param2` (integer): [Description]
- **Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {}
}
```

**POST /api/endpoint**
- **Description:** [What it does]
