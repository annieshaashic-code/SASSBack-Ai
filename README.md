## 🚀 Running Locally (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1 — Install Python
Download Python 3.10+ from [python.org](https://python.org/downloads).  
✅ Tick **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation.

### Step 2 — Install dependencies

Open a terminal (PowerShell on Windows) and run:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\sass\backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3 — Set up your API key (optional but recommended)

```powershell
# Copy the template
copy .env.example .env
```

Then open `.env` in Notepad and add your OpenAI key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
FLASK_ENV=development
```

> 💡 **No API key?** The app works perfectly with the built-in curated fallback comebacks — no key needed for the hackathon demo!

### Step 4 — Start the backend server

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\sass\backend
python app.py
```

You'll see:
```
🧚‍♀️ Fairy Godmother warming up on port 5000...
✨ Database initialised!
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

### Step 5 — Open the app

Open your browser and go to:  
👉 **[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)**

That's it! The Flask server serves the frontend automatically. ✨
